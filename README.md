# Torrentino
 
[WIP] A blazingly fast bit torrent client written in pure and idiomatic Rust. Torrentino is the final project of the
[Otus Rust Developer Course](https://otus.ru/lessons/rust-developer/).


### Delivery types ![progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/?scale=3&width=120&color=babaca&suffix=%20of%203)

The result of this project can be delivered to users in different types. These types will vary by the interaction
with end user and the environment around the application. There are three types, but only cli option is marked as
`must to have` due the limit of time for project implementation. Optional delivery types might be implemented (or
might not be implemented) depending on remaining time till the end of the course.

1. [ ] [must to have] cli client for Macos
1. [ ] [optional] desktop application for Macos
1. [ ] [optional] web app (with backend and front-end)

### Must to have feature list ![progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/?scale=4&width=120&color=babaca&suffix=%20of%204)

As the header states, the following list contains the major features, without them the result of the
project will be useless. These features can be considered as first priority tasks.

1. [ ] open and display internals of the given *.torrent file 
1. [ ] implement the basics of bittorrent protocol
1. [ ] interact with torrent-server
1. [ ] download and save file from torrent-peers

### Nice to have feature list ![progress](https://progress-bar.dev/0/?scale=5&width=120&color=babaca&suffix=%20of%205)

1. [ ] parallel downloads with progress bar
1. [ ] download only chosen part of torrent
1. [ ] act as a torrent peer/seed for downloaded files
1. [ ] pause and continue download processes
1. [ ] for cli version provide possibility to install via homebrew (or apt-get) [Instruction](https://docs.brew.sh/Adding-Software-to-Homebrew#casks)

The future list of this project might be updated during the course and based on the implementation progress. It should be
 a complete product which allows user to download any data from public bit-torrent servers. Many ideas and inspiration was 
 taken from [How to make your own bittorrent client](https://allenkim67.github.io/programming/2016/05/04/how-to-make-your-own-bittorrent-client.html#opening-the-torrent-file) guide

### Resources

1. [BitTorrentSpecification](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification) - Detailed and very readable unofficial
bittorrent specification
1. [UDP Tracker Protocol for BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html) - An official specification of
bit torrent protocol. I recommend to read unofficial one first, just because is more understandable from newbies
point of view.
1. [The BitTorrent Protocol](https://www.morehawes.co.uk/old-guides/the-bittorrent-protocol) Another good high level explanation of the BitTorrent protocol
